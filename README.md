# Merge Alternately

## Description

This Java program defines a `mergeAlternately` method that takes two input strings and merges them character by character in an alternating fashion. If one string is longer, the remaining characters are appended at the end.

## Problem Statement

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, merge them by alternating characters from each string. If one string is longer, append the extra characters at the end.

### Example:

#### **Input:**
```java
word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqrxyz"
